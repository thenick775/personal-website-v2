Note: This was replaced with the [v3](https://github.com/thenick775/personal-website-v3) version

This is the home of my personal website, desktop and mobile friendly.

I thought after a few years and a few jobs, that my website needed a new look!

I chose to make this project with Hugo, as an exercise in learning something new.

Major thanks to the [Hugo Grayscale](https://github.com/runningstream/hugograyscale) template creator for inspiration.

This project is powered by Docker and NGINX, and is served from a cloud hosting provider.

Fail2ban was added as, on most cloud providers, bots started mining for exploits.

# Technical details

- This website's build pipeline is an example of a multi-stage docker build using Hugo
- This website uses a basic custom nginx configuration
- This website uses fail2ban to temporarily ban problematic IP addresses through firewall rules using the nginx logs
- Certbot certificates are in use, making for easy periodic renewal
